Note: To comment in R programming use hash-tag below are the operations on data-set customer.csv the link will be attached here,we will be 
exploring and editing the data availbale

#Questions on operators:
#1.Working with arithmetic operators:
#a.Add 5 to the fifth record of 'MonthlyCharges' column
#b.Subtract 9.65 from the sixth record of 'MonthlyCharges' column
#c.Multiply the 1st record of 'MonthlyCharges' column with 3
#d.Divide the 37th record of 'MonthlyCharges' column with 3

getwd()                                                                #gets working directory
CC<- read.csv("Customer_Churn.csv")                                    #Assigning CC as object for customer churn data-set
CC                                                                     #calling out Customer churn data-set in R
summary(CC)                                        
str(CC)

CC$MonthlyCharges[5]+5 -> CC$MonthlyCharges[5]
CC$MonthlyCharges[5]

CC$MonthlyCharges[6]-9.65

CC$MonthlyCharges[1]*3

CC$MonthlyCharges[37]/3

#2.Working with the relational operators:
#a.Check if the value of 'tenure' in the 1st row is greater than the value of 'tenure' in the 10th row
#Check if the value of 'tenure' in the 3rd row is equal to the value of 'tenure' in the 5th row

CC$tenure[1] > CC$tenure[10]
CC$tenure[3]==CC$tenure[5]

#3.Working with logical operators:
 #a.Get the count of those customers who have subscribed to both "TechSupport" & "StreamingTV"
#b.Extract those customers whose 'InternetService' is either 'DSL' or 'Fiber optic' & store the result in 'Internet_dsl_fiber'

CC$TechSupport=="Yes" & CC$StreamingTV=="Yes" -> TechS_streamtv_churn 
table(TechS_streamtv_churn)

CC$InternetService== "DSL" | CC$InternetService== "Fiber optic" -> dsl_fiber
dsl_fiber
subset(CC,dsl_fiber==T)-> Internet_dsl_fiber
Internet_dsl_fiber
